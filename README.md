Static version of search results screens built with React.JS, Next.JS.


## Development Notes

### Git

Use `deploy_develop` branch as base branch.

### Installation 

1. User correct `.npmrc` file.

When you need install correct packages to `node_modules` you might need remove `.npmrc` file so app will refer to your global `.npmrc` file, install packages and move this file back. 
This need to be applied for `@bytebrand/` packages especially since it uses global `.npmrc` by default.   

This local `.npmrc` file is required for correct build on gitlab, not for local development.
